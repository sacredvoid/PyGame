This repo contains my work on PyGame <br />
Simply run the Snake_Game.py after you have installed the PyGame package. <br />
Installing PyGame for <br />
WINDOWS: Go to the URL http://pygame.org and click on the “Downloads” link. Download the PyGame for your operating system.<br />
LINUX: Open a terminal and run “sudo apt-get install python-pygame” <br />
Then run 'import pygame' in your interactive shell. This shouldn't give any errors, if it does, try installing it again step by step. <br />

# PyGame
This repo contains my work on PyGame
Simply run the Snake_Game.py after you have installed the PyGame package.
Installing PyGame for
WINDOWS: Go to the URL http://pygame.org and click on the “Downloads” link. Download the PyGame for your operating system.
LINUX: Open a terminal and run “sudo apt-get install python-pygame”
Then run 'import pygame' in your interactive shell. This shouldn't give any errors, if it does, try installing it again step by step.
